# Hi there, I’m Raúl 👋

### 🚀 Software Engineer | Problem Solver | Community Builder

I’m passionate about software development and enjoy turning problems (yes, even those tricky bugs) into learning opportunities. My current stack includes **Python**, **React**, and **TypeScript**—and I love blending logic with creativity!

- 🔍 **Exploring:** React, TypeScript, algorithms, and all things that challenge my mind.
- 🧠 **Mindset:** Every bug is a stepping stone, every project a chance to grow.
